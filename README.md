# W25Q32JV Flash driver

[![crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/w25q32jv.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/w25q32jv) [![Documentation](https://docs.rs/w25q32jv/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/w25q32jv)

This is a generic driver for the W25Q32JV and W25Q128FV flash chip from Winbond. It probably also works with other similar variants.

It supports:
- Blocking SPI using `embedded-hal 1.0`
- Async SPI using `embedded-hal-async`
- Blocking `embedded-storage`
- Async `embedded-storage-async`

To unlock the use of async, activate the `async` feature on the crate.
Default is W25Q32(32 M-bit), activate `+megabits64` to support W25Q64(64 M-bit), or `+megabits128` to support W25Q128(128 M-bit).

Defmt is also supported through the `defmt` feature.

## TODO

- Fast read support. So far there's only support for the normal read, so don't use a SPI speed of > 50Mhz
